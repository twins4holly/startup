## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch
Have you ever borrowed a book from your friend and forgot that you had it? Or maybe you were halfway through one when you decided to start another? This is no longer a problem because you can track the books you are reading on My Reads. Users can login to add, remove, or view the books they are currenlty reading to their bookshelf. They can connect to other readers by seeing in real time when other users add or remove books from their shelves. Readers never have to forget their books ever again.
